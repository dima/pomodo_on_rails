Description:
    Generates the primary RestfulX project directory structure and sets 
    up Flex Builder and TextMate specific descriptor files
    
    You can generate Flex Builder configuration for either *pure* Flex
    project or an AIR project. To generate AIR configuration pass the -a
    (--air) option to the generator.
    
    You can also choose to generate a simple Google App Engine back-end
    along with your Flex front-end by passing the --gae option.

Examples:
    `rx-gen pomodo`     # generates project structure and a 
                        # default Flex app configuration.
    `rx-gen -a pomodo`  # as above but generates an AIR app
                        # and configuration
    `rx-gen --gae pomodo` # generate Flex + GAE application
                          # configuration
                           
Next Steps:
    In your new RestfulX project folder run `ruby script/generate` for
    a list of available generators.
