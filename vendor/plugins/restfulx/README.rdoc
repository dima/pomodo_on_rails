= RestfulX Framework: The RESTful way to develop Adobe Flex and AIR applications

== Description

Here's some of the things you can do with *RestfulX*:

* *Create* a complete _Adobe_ _Flex_ or _AIR_ application in less than 5 minutes.

  Use our lightweight Ruby-based code generation toolkit to create a fully functional
  CRUD application. Simply do:
  
    sudo gem install restfulx
  
  And then run:
  
    rx-gen -h

* *Integrate* with _Ruby_ _On_ _Rails_, _Merb_ or _Sinatra_ applications 
  that use _ActiveRecord_, _DataMapper_, _CouchRest_, _ActiveCouch_ and so on.

* *Communicate* between your Flex/AIR Rich Internet Application and service providers 
  using either _AMF_, _XML_ or _JSON_.
  
* *Persist* your data directly in Adobe AIR _SQLite_ database or _CouchDB_ 
  without any additional infrastructure or intermediate servers.
  
* *Deploy* your RestfulX application on the Google App Engine and use Google
  DataStore for persistence.
  
* *Synchronize* your data between AIR _SQLite_ and other service providers.
